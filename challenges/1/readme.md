# OrtizBot Challenge 1

## Introduction

Welcome to the OrtizBot Challenge - Block and Score! This manual will guide you through an exciting game where robots must navigate an arena, locate colored blocks, and strategically score points by moving the blocks into designated nets. The challenge comes in three levels, each with varying difficulty.

## Materials Needed

1. **Game Elements:**
   - Colored blocks (red, green, blue)
   - Nets or designated scoring areas
   - Arena with boundaries

2. **Robot Components:**
   - Motors for movement
   - Color sensors for block identification
   - Grippers or arms (for moving blocks)
   - Proximity sensors for navigation

3. **Controller:**
   - Microcontroller or Raspberry Pi for processing and decision-making

4. **Power Supply:**
   - Batteries or a power source suitable for your robot's needs

## Game Levels

### Level 1: Single Color Scoring

1. **Objective:**
   - Robots must find and move blocks of a specified color (e.g., red) into the corresponding net.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each successfully scored block.

### Level 2: Multi-Color Scoring

1. **Objective:**
   - Robots must find and identify blocks of different colors (e.g., red, green, blue) and move them into their respective nets.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each correctly scored block.
   - Bonus points for scoring blocks in a specific order or within a time limit.

### Level 3: Randomized Color Scoring

1. **Objective:**
   - Robots must navigate the arena, identify the color of each block (which may be randomly placed), and score them in the correct nets.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each correctly scored block.
   - Deductions for incorrectly scored blocks.
   - Bonus points for completing the challenge within a time limit.

## Rules

1. **Color Identification:**
   - Robots must use color sensors to accurately identify the color of each block.

2. **Navigation:**
   - Proximity sensors should be used for safe navigation within the arena.

3. **Block Handling:**
   - Robots must use grippers or arms to lift and transport blocks to the designated nets.

4. **Time Limit:**
   - Specify a time limit for each level to add an element of challenge.

5. **Autonomous Operation:**
   - Robots must operate autonomously without external guidance during the challenge.

## Scoring System

- **Color Identification:**
  - Points awarded for correctly identifying each block's color.

- **Block Scoring:**
  - Points awarded for successfully moving blocks into the designated nets.

- **Bonus Points:**
  - Bonus points for completing the challenge within the specified time.

- **Penalties:**
  - Deductions for incorrect color identification or scoring.

## Testing and Iteration

Before the official competition, conduct thorough testing to ensure fairness and balance in the game. Adjust the level of difficulty based on the capabilities of the robots.

## Conclusion

The ColorBot Challenge - Block and Score is a thrilling game that combines color identification, strategic decision-making, and precise movement.
