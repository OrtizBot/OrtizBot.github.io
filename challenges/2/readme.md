# RoboTag - Color Conquest

## Introduction

Welcome to RoboTag - Color Conquest! In this thrilling game, robots engage in a high-stakes mission to tag and conquer colored zones across the arena. The challenge involves not only swift navigation and evasion but also strategic decision-making to dominate the playing field.

## Materials Needed

1. **Game Elements:**
   - Colored zones (red, green, blue)
   - Obstacles for strategic cover
   - Arena with boundaries
   - Tokens or markers for tagging

2. **Robot Components:**
   - Motors for agile movement
   - Color sensors for zone identification
   - Grippers or arms (for tagging zones)
   - Proximity sensors for navigation and evasion

3. **Controller:**
   - Microcontroller or Raspberry Pi for processing and decision-making

4. **Power Supply:**
   - Batteries or a power source suitable for your robot's needs

## Game Levels

### Level 1: Color Zone Tagging

1. **Objective:**
   - Robots must navigate the arena, identify colored zones, and tag them using markers.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each successfully tagged zone.

### Level 2: Dynamic Conquest Challenge

1. **Objective:**
   - Colored zones change dynamically in real-time, and robots must adapt their strategy to tag the zones as they shift.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each successfully tagged zone.
   - Bonus points for adapting to dynamic changes quickly.

### Level 3: Tactical Domination Race

1. **Objective:**
   - Multiple colored zones are scattered across the arena, and robots must strategically plan their tagging route to maximize points within a time limit.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Points awarded for each successfully tagged zone.
   - Bonus points for completing the challenge within the specified time.

## Rules

1. **Color Identification:**
   - Robots must use color sensors to accurately identify the color of each zone.

2. **Navigation and Evasion:**
   - Proximity sensors should be used for agile navigation and strategic evasion of opponents.

3. **Zone Tagging:**
   - Robots must use grippers or arms to tag zones with markers.

4. **Time Limit:**
   - Specify a time limit for each level to add urgency and challenge.

5. **Autonomous Operation:**
   - Robots must operate autonomously without external guidance during the challenge.

## Scoring System

- **Color Identification:**
  - Points awarded for correctly identifying the color of each zone.

- **Tagging Accuracy:**
  - Points awarded for correctly tagging zones.

- **Bonus Points:**
  - Bonus points for completing the challenge within the specified time.

- **Penalties:**
  - Deductions for incorrect color identification or tagging.



## Conclusion

RoboTag - Color Conquest is an action-packed game that tests robots in color identification, strategic tagging, and dynamic adaptation. Have fun building, testing, and competing in this vibrant robotic challenge! May the most strategic and agile robot emerge as the RoboTag champion!
