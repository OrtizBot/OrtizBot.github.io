## About Us

OrtizBot is committed to unlocking affordable robotics programs for schools with limited budgets, providing opportunities for students to engage in 21st-century robotics activities.

## Our Initiatives

### OrtizBot V1

We are currently working on the OrtizBot V1, a cost-effective robotics kit designed to enable schools with lesser budgets to participate in robotics programs. Our goal is to release the OrtizBot V1 in November 2024, offering an accessible and innovative solution for schools. The current list of parts is available [here](/V1).

### OrtizIDE

In addition to the hardware, we are developing the OrtizIDE, an integrated development environment tailored for our robotics projects. We anticipate releasing the OrtizIDE in June 2024, providing a user-friendly platform for programming and interacting with OrtizBot devices.
